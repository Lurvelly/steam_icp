# STEAM-ICP

Paper: [IMU as an Input vs. a Measurement of the State in Inertial-Aided State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05968)

In this paper, we implemented lidar-inertial odometry using a Singer prior where body-centric acceleration is included in the state. In the paper, we refer to this as our Singer prior lidar(-inertial) odometry which can be configured to be lidar-only, lidar + gyro, or lidar-inertial using both accelerometer and gyroscope. This is implemented in `steam_icp/src/odometry/steam_lio.cpp` where `use_imu=True` in the configuration yaml enables the use of an IMU.

Paper: [Continuous-Time Radar-Inertial and Lidar-Inertial Odometry using a Gaussian Process Motion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06174)

In the paper, we implemented radar-inertial and lidar-inertial odometry using a white-noise-on-acceleration prior where accelerometer measurements are preintegrated to form relative velocity factors. We compare several variants of our approach such as lidar-only: STEAM-LO, lidar-inertial: STEAM-LIO, radar-only: STEAM-RO, and radar-inertial: STEAM-RIO. STEAM-LO and STEAM-LIO are implemented in `steam_icp/src/odometry/steam_lo.cpp` where `use_imu=True` in the configuration yaml enables the use of an IMU. Similarly, STEAM-RO and STEAM-RIO are implemented in `steam_icp/odometry/steam_ro.cpp`.

To be clear, the algorithms associated with the "continuous-time radar-inertial ..." are implemented in `steam_lo.cpp` and `steam_ro.cpp` which use the white-noise-on-acceleration prior. The algorithms associated with the "imu as input ..." paper are implemented in `steam_lio.cpp` which uses a Singer prior.

Previous Paper: [Picking Up Speed: Continuous-Time Lidar-Only Odometry using Doppler Velocity Measurements](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9968059)

In our previous work, we demonstrate continuous-time lidar odometry which incorporated Doppler velocity measurements from an Aeva lidar. For code that pertains to the picking-up-speed paper, `git checkout picking_up_speed`

Datasets: [Boreas (ours)](https://www.boreas.utias.utoronto.ca/) and [KITTI-raw/360 (made available by the authors of CT-ICP)](https://github.com/jedeschaud/ct_icp) and [Aeva (a collaboration between us and Aeva)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JpQNnXejow3qy1qp5tVzak9qnuFmjYHW/view?usp=share_link) and [Newer College Dataset](https://ori-drs.github.io/newer-college-dataset/)

## Installation

Clone this repository and its submodules.

We use docker to install dependencies The recommended way to build the docker image is

```bash
docker build -t steam_icp \
  --build-arg USERID=$(id -u) \
  --build-arg GROUPID=$(id -g) \
  --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) \
  --build-arg HOMEDIR=${HOME} .
```

When starting a container, remember to mount the code, dataset, and output directories to proper locations in the container.
An example command to start a docker container with the image is

```bash
docker run -it --name steam_icp \
  --privileged \
  --network=host \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v ${HOME}:${HOME}:rw \
  steam_icp
```

(Inside Container) Go to the root directory of this repository and build STEAM-ICP

```bash
bash build.sh
```

## Experiments

Commands below should be run in the docker container.

```bash

source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d ${WORKING_DIR}/steam_icp/rviz/steam_icp.rviz # launch rviz
```

Running the lidar-inertial simulation:
```
ros2 run steam_icp simulation --ros-args --params-file ${WORKING_DIR}/steam_icp/simulation/sim.yaml
```

Note that some of the code for generating maps and plots for the "continuous-time radar-inertial..." paper is located on the `map_and_plots` branch.

In terms of outputs, you should get something similar to the files in the [results](./results) directory.
